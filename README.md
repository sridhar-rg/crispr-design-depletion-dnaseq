# CRISPR Design for Depletion of Abundant Molecules in DNA Sequencing Applications

Description of bioinformatics pipelines and methods to design CRISPRs for DNA sequencing applications

## The Why? 

DNA sequencing is a popular method to interrogate the genome. However, for applications that require enhanced sequencing depth at targeted sections of the genome, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) comes with some challenges. Here are some examples:

1. For metagenomics studies, the host DNA often dominates sequencing data and dilutes the microbial content for genome assemblies
2. In argi-genomics applications (e.g. plant genotyping), researchers would like to study the variants in the functional parts of plant genomes. Plant genomes are generally larger and less than 5% of their genome is functional. WES is a viable alternative, but may require the design and synthesis of probes (and the expenses that come with it)
3. The study of gene regulation in animal genomes is another example where 10-20% of the genome requires additional focus
